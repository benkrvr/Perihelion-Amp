# Perihelion, Modular JFET Guitar Amplifier Head

Perihelion is a compact, solid-state guitar amplifier head built around a JFET-based adaptation of the Marshall 2203 preamp. It provides rich, dynamic clean and overdriven tones while remaining low-voltage

This amplifier is designed to work as part of a two-module system with its companion unit, **Aphelion**, a Space-Echo-style effects head. Perihelion provides the primary tone and drive, while Aphelion adds delay, reverb, and modulation for a spacious, atmospheric sound.

## Concept

The project is space-themed:

- **Perihelion**  the point in an orbit closest to the Sun, symbolizing the amp as the core energy source.
- **Aphelion**  the point in an orbit farthest from the Sun, representing the atmospheric FX module.

Together, they form a modular guitar rig where Perihelion delivers the main tone, and Aphelion provides spatial, ethereal effects.
